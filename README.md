# Age-Calculator
This Python script calculates a person's exact age in years, months, and days. It takes the user's birthdate as input and compares it with the current date using the datetime module. It adjusts for negative days and months to ensure accurate results. The program then displays the user's precise age, making it a simple yet effective age calculator.
